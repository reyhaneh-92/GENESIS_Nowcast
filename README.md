# GENESIS_Nowcast
This repository contains the code for our proposed GENESIS (Global prEcipitation Nowcasting using intEgrated multi-Satellite retrIevalS for GPM) models, as described in the paper "Global Precipitation Nowcasting of Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM: A U-Net Convolutional LSTM Architecture."

The "Models" folder provides details on our proposed models, including the trained models. The remaining files are used to properly read the data, create, train, and save the models. Finally, the trained models are utilized to predict precipitation on a global scale.

The "GENESIS notebook" demonstrates the procedure for using the trained network to perform global precipitation nowcasting on a single sample.
